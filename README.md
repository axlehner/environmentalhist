The goal of environmentalhist is to …

## Installation

You can install the development version of environmentalhist from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("axlehner/environmentalhist")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(environmentalhist)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
#summary(cars)
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

# COLLABORATION (@DYLAN)

Open the urbanhist.Rproj Rproject in RStudio and make sure `devtools` is
installed. Then you just hit ‘Cmd + Shift + B’ every time you put a new
function in the R folder or change something. That installs the package
onto your disk and you have it globally everywhere.

For the data storage and documentation I need to readup on best
practices in R packages. There is always a `\data` and a `\data-raw`
folder

Descriptions are in the `\vignettes` folder

That’s it. Don’t worry about the rest for now.
